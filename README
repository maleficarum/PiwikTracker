PiwikTracker: Simple Groovy Piwik Tracker
===========================================

PiwikTracker for groovy allows you to post visited page information to your piwik tracking system. It's very useful when you use REST (by example)
and you don't have a view to show in the client's browser

This is a initial port from java to groovy based on http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2172.

I don't know the author of that code, so, please, for further information about java code, visit to below URL.
